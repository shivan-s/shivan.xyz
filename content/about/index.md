## Who am I?

My name is Shivan (pronounced Shiv-arn).

I am Kiwi born 🇳🇿 with Sri Lankan 🇱🇰 heritage.

I currently work as a **Software Developer** after 7 years working as an **[Optometrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry)**.

## What am I up to now?

I am living in Palmerston North with my parents. I am working in a job I love, which is software development for a global contact lens manufacturing, which is a perfect intersection of my previous occupation and my current one.

Outside work I practice [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), [Latin Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_dance), [Weightlifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting), and [Pole Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_sports).

I am working on my [Private Pilot License](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/licensing-and-certification/pilots/pilot-licensing/) certification.

I am also interested in writing, photography, film, and reading.

## What Is The Purpose Of This Website?

This is my digital garden. It's my stake on the internet.

It's a vessel for my thoughts through writing as well as various others forms of creativity.

I want to be okay with sharing my thoughts and putting it out there into the world for those who care to listen.
