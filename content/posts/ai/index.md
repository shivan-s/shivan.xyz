For a while I have always have a keen eye for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Even if I didn't pursue AI to a deep level, it did act as a gateway for me into programming.

When the initial implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) came out, I was actually quite excited. I even made a small project where it would query the ChatGPT API to generate referral letters for optometrist (I deleted for reasons you will find out).

However, when seeing AI writing code, followed by the sleuths of social media posts calling the end of software development and the worship of machine written code, then all excitement evaporated and I buried my head in the sand.

Air France 447.

You would not expect a pilot to handfly and aircraft.

Would you expect a Software developer to work without tooling, without AI.

Then does AI become the normality?

Pilots are encouraged to hand fly so they don't deskill.

Balance and black and white thinking.

Don't forget the basics and fundamentals.
