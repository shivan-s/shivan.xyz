I state my problems with reading like so:

1. Reading is exercise. Like going to the gym, I feel happy went; I feel bad if I didn't. I'd rather be grativated towards reading, as simple as turning on the television.
2. I don't know what to read. Most of what I read is algorithmically recommended non-fiction. I would rather like to read more meaningful fiction that makes you think and works your mind to think orginally.

Reading is like eating your. You know it's good for you but it involves a but of activation energy to partake. School probably didn't help. It made reading an academic exercise.

As I write this now, I envy the bookworms who seem to comprehend and devour books, even the most verbose and hard-to-read texts out there. _Why can't that be me_?

I didn't read the _Harry Potter_ series until my mid-twenties (I got stuck on _Order of the Pheonix_...). Years into my work life, I rarely picked up any books. One that came to mind was [Yeonmi Park's _In Order To Live_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeonmi_Park). The drought of books ended when I discovered the world self-help.

For binging useless YouTube videos after work into the late of night I went down the rabbit hole starting with:

- _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear
- _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_ by Stephen R. Covey

I also enjoyed books written about major historical events like _Into Thin Air_ by Jon Krakauer. Adding to this, books about business, personal finance; my diet is very non-fiction and self-help, which is fine to an extent.

I made attempts to branch out based on recommendations from others as well as to gain experience from others. One example is I identify as male, so it's good to gain other perspectives:

- _Invisible Women_ by ...
- _Lean In_ by S ...
- _Vagina Bible_ by ....

However, a significant realisation I had was that I couldn't really think on my own. Non-fiction, though being informative, force feeds you knowledge. Good for parties where the knowledge is fresh, but I feel is slowly fading away.

Looking at back in high school where we studied:

- **Animal Farm** by George Orwell
- **Othello** by William Shakespeare
- **The Heart of Darkness** by Joseph Conrad

The notion of these texts still live with me today. Probably, one, because we had a teacher explain the ideas behind them, but also they were fiction and they encouraged us to think.

But the major realisation for me was that I had no real thoughts of my own. Though I was learning, I wasn't exercising my mind to think on it's own. That's the danger of non-fiction. Not in the sense, you question the facts for sure; but fiction is where you need to interpret - you need to think on your own.

I think it's a good idea to broaden the horizons. I want to read **and enjoy** classic literature.

And where am I going to start?

With _The Odyssey_ by "Homer".

This is a tough one, since _The Odyssey_ was created during the time when there was no novel or written text, and it certainly wasn't written in plain modern, modern English.
