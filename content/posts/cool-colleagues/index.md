There is still lots left on the table that I wish I had accomplished this year:

1. I wish I made more personal projects that weren't just web projects
2. I wish I wrote more blog posts and created more content
3. I wish I studyied and read more

Naturally, you make big goals, never achieve them, and you find yourself acceptng that you will always be disappointed.

However, I forget what I _did_ achieve or how I've evolved in my career. And that's what I want to share with you in this post.o

## But, First

Let's start with a highlight for the year - an example of how cool my colleague is.

First, let me set the scene. Imagine that sinking feeling you feel in you stomach. A bug you wrote into production.

Before you can process the guilt, you are frantically coming up with a fix.

Heart beating for hours, you finally come up with a fix. You acknowledge the team of the problem and as you are about to sign off, your colleague says this:

> God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers

What a champ! And all those uncomfortable emotions that you had, all that self-doubt, subside in that moment.

So thank you to that colleague (who likely isn't reading this for uplifting my sprits).

On that note, I think a good resource for homework is:

- [_Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure_](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/).

## Smaller PRs and Product Thinking

These two books:

- _Accelerate_ by [Nicole Forsgren, PhD](https://nicolefv.com/), Jez Humble and Gene Kim.
- _[The Phoenix Project]_ by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford

have changed how I conduct my PRs.

I now split my PRs into smaller chunks with the goal of creating features with small iterative changes.

Not only does this make it easier to review; it's also the fix any small bugs that may crop up in production.

On top of this, smaller PRs help break down problems and allow correctiion in case there is a misdiretion in understanding of the implementation.

Finally to add to this point. We aren't just writing code, we are contributing to business. Code the core to the business.

Code that is well written is easier to add features to, fix bugs, as well as change - which helps the business perform better. This is where small PRs can help in a way. But small PRs also get us to focus on good quality software.

This has also made me think about how to create a better product and become more product focused. I always think - how will my code impact the business in a positive (or even negative) way.

## Programming is Art and it's a Craft

I'm impressed with the Barista. Detail is required with making a coffee: the dosing, the grind size, the tamper of the plaque, and with every coffee - how do I make it better than the last?

Or how about the Pilot? Every landing is better. Practice old skills because if you don't you lose them. Practice emergencies like a forced landing without power. What happens if I get stuck in bad weather?

Both examples of professions are constantly reflecting and trying to improve their respective craft.

My entry into this career has been a blessing. In realising my luck, I've made the effort to treat programming like a craft like flying a plane or making a coffee.

I've supplemented by top-down learning approach (one where I had no idea how the lower level implementation work such as memory management in C) with going deep.

My attempts are to:

- plough through the [wizard book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
- [learn C++](https://github.com/shivan-s/learn-cpp)
- try a new language a year for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - [this year I did Elixir](https://github.com/shivan-s/aoc/tree/main/2025)

On top of this, I will also make the effort to remain grounded. Don't forget the basics - do your job and do it well in a timely matter and with minimum fuss.

## Conclusion

I have improved in 2025. I have cool colleauges. I write small PRs, and I have adopted a mindset or treating programming like a craft to continually get better.

I'm excited to see where 2026 takes me (us?)! Thanks for reading.
